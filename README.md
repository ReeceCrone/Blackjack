## BLACKJACK

This is a little BlackJack game I made during the summer of 2024. 

It's just like a normal game of BlackJack with the exception that I have not yet implemented
a way to split cards or to double down.

You start with a total of $75.00 and there is nothing to do except gamble it away

You can increment you bet up or down by $5.00
